# Attack On Titans: Utopia

## Overview
"Attack on Titan: Utopia" is a 1-player, endless tower defense game built using the JavaFX framework. The game is inspired by the popular anime Attack on Titan and takes place in an imaginary scenario where the titans have breached Wall Maria and reached the northern border of Wall Rose at the Utopia District.

## Installation and Requirements
To run the "Attack on Titan: Utopia" game, you will need to have the following:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The game is built using Java, so you'll need to have a compatible JDK installed on your system. We recommend using the latest stable version of the JDK.

2. **JavaFX**: The game utilizes the JavaFX framework for the graphical user interface and game logic. You can either use the JavaFX SDK bundled with your JDK or download the standalone JavaFX SDK.

3. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: We suggest using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run and develop the game.

To install the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the game repository from the official source or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Make sure the JDK and JavaFX SDK are properly configured in your IDE's project settings.
4. Build and run the game's main class to start playing.

## Game Features
The game features the following elements:

- **Battlefield**: The battlefield is divided into multiple lanes, each with a section of the wall to defend.
- **Titans**: The game features several types of titans, each with unique attributes such as health points, damage, speed, and danger level.
- **Anti-Titan Weapons**: The player can purchase and deploy a variety of weapons, each with its own damage, price, and range characteristics.
- **Game Rules**: The game has no winning condition; the player's objective is to survive for as long as possible and defeat as many titans as possible.
- **Game Flow**: The battle has three phases: Early, Intense, and Grumbling, which are determined by the number of turns that have passed.

## Gameplay
In "Attack on Titan: Utopia," the player must strategically deploy the available Anti-Titan weapons along the lanes to fend off the approaching titans and protect the walls. The player can upgrade existing weapons or purchase new ones to increase their defensive capabilities.

The game ends when all the starting lanes become "lost lanes" (i.e., their wall parts are destroyed).
